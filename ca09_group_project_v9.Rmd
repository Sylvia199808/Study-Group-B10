We use glimpse() to have a look at the data. There are 74 variables and presumably we might not actually need all of them, because some might be overlapping and some irrelevant.
```{r, glimpse data frame}

glimpse(listings)


```

## In our EDA, we will attempt to answer to following questions:

1. Which variables are relevant?
2. Does the data need cleaning?
3. Do we have outliers which we need to exclude?
4. Are there variables we need to convert?
5. Are there any additional variables we need to create based on the manipulation of existing data?
6. What is the relationship between the relevant variables? (Through this, we want to examine how successfully independent variables explain dependent variables)
7. What are the dependent and independent variables?`review_scores_rating`: Average review score (0 - 100)


--- QUESTIONS 1, 2 AND 3 ---
## Straight away, we can see from above that while many variables seem good. In this section, we will tackle Questions 1 through 3 by picking out relevant variables, cleaning them up and removing outliers and NA values. 

## There are some issues with the data frame above:

## Firstly, some of the pieces of data are of the wrong type or contain irrelevant data. For example, "price" is not only a "character" variable, but also contains the troublesome "$" symbol, which must be removed before proper analysis can begin. Also, the "bathrooms_text" data seems to be of use to our analysis, but first we need to once again turn it into a double-type data and remove the pesky text from it.

## Secondly, some of the data is located in irrelevant areas. The "host_location" data has data which is not located in Barcelona, and as such we must filter out pieces of data from irrelevant locations in the data frame.

## Thirdly, there are some variables that seem a bit useless. For example, the "last_scraped" data, "name" and other such data seem a bit useless for analytical purposes, so we have to filter out these useless variables.

## Fourthly, there are NA values which we must omit for our analysis to be as accurate as possible.

### Q4-7 answers missing ###



```{r, create Barcelona data frame and filter for correct location}

barcelona <- listings %>% 
  filter(host_location %in% c("Barcelona", 
                              "BARCELONA", 
                              "Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain", 
                              "Barcelona, BARCELONA, Spain",
                              "Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",
                              "Barcelona, Cataluña, Spain",
                              "Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain")) 
 
```

## We start out by cleansing out the entire data frame for only entries in which "Barcelona" is mentioned so that henceforth we know we are only wrangling relevant geographical data.

## Having done this, we can now filter out the data frame for specific variables that we wish to analyse, turn the problematic pieces of data into their correct data types, and remove the NA data from our frame (thus fixing the other issues mentioned above).

## After thorough consideration, we decided that the factors which are most interesting and relevant to our EDA are in relation to the characteristics of the hosts themselves and their properties. 

```{r, select relevant variables for our barcelona data frame}

barcelona <- listings %>%  
  select(
         id,
         host_response_rate,
         host_acceptance_rate,
         host_is_superhost,
         host_listings_count,
         host_has_profile_pic,
         host_identity_verified,
         neighbourhood_cleansed,
         has_availability,
         instant_bookable,
         neighbourhood_group_cleansed,
         latitude,
         longitude,
         property_type,
         room_type,
         property_type,
         accommodates,
         bathrooms_text,
         bedrooms,
         beds,
         price,
         minimum_nights,
         maximum_nights,
         availability_30,
         number_of_reviews,
         review_scores_rating,
         review_scores_accuracy,
         review_scores_cleanliness,
         review_scores_checkin,
         review_scores_communication,
         review_scores_location,
         review_scores_value,
         reviews_per_month,
         instant_bookable
         )

# We convert the price from character to numeric
barcelona$price <- as.numeric(gsub("\\$","",barcelona$price))

#We convert bathrooms_text into a variable with number of bathrooms
barcelona$bathrooms <- substr(barcelona$bathrooms_text, 1,2)
barcelona$bathrooms <- as.numeric(gsub("\\.","",barcelona$bathrooms))

#omit NA variables
barcelona <- na.omit(barcelona)
skim(barcelona)

```
## Having now pulled the specific variables we want to analyse in our data frame and tidied it up a bit, we then proceed to separate property types based on specific subgroups.

```{r, create a categorical variable for property type}
#we group the property types into 5 categories according to frequency distribution to only control for the largest subgroups
barcelona <- barcelona %>%
  mutate(prop_type_simplified = case_when(
    property_type %in% c("Entire rental unit","Private room in rental unit", "Entire serviced apartment","Entire condominium (condo)") ~ property_type, 
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))

#We check whether the categorization has been performed correctly
barcelona %>%
  count(property_type, prop_type_simplified) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 



```



## Now, to make our analysis more comprehensive, we further split our data frame into 5 different categories:

- Host Specific: Data frame looking specifically at data relating to hosts themselves

- Property Specific: Data frame looking at specific characteristics of the properties

- Reviews Specific: Data frame looking at how users reviewed specific aspects of these properties and hosts

- Logical Specific: Data frame analysing whether listings meet specific requirements

- Categorical Specific: Data frame looking at the different neighbourhoods and types of properties we listed above


```{r, creation of categorical variable neighbourhood_simplified }
#Here we categorize the grouped neighbourhoods in Barcelona in 4 different categories: North, Center, Coastal Line, and West
barcelona <- barcelona %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood_simplified = case_when(
    neighbourhood_group_cleansed %in% c("Horta-Guinardó","Nou Barris","Sarrià-Sant Gervasi") ~ "North",
    neighbourhood_group_cleansed %in% c("Eixample", "Gracia") ~ "Center",
    neighbourhood_group_cleansed %in% c("Ciutat Vella", "Sant Martí","Sants-Montjuïc") ~ "Coastal line",
    TRUE ~ "West"
  ))

barcelona %>%
  count(neighbourhood_group_cleansed, neighbourhood_simplified) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

```


```{r, create different data frames according to type and content}


host_specific <- barcelona %>% 
  select(host_response_rate,
         host_acceptance_rate,
         host_listings_count
         )

property_specific <- barcelona %>% 
  select(accommodates,
         bedrooms,
         beds,
         bathrooms,
         )

reviews_specific <- barcelona %>% 
  select(number_of_reviews,
         review_scores_accuracy,
         review_scores_checkin,
         review_scores_cleanliness,
         review_scores_location,
         review_scores_communication,
         review_scores_value,
         review_scores_rating
         )

logical_specific <- barcelona %>% 
  select(host_is_superhost,
         host_has_profile_pic,
         host_identity_verified,
         has_availability,
         instant_bookable)


categorical_specific <- barcelona %>% 
  select(neighbourhood_group_cleansed,
         prop_type_simplified,
         room_type)

```
## Firstly, we look at the property-related variables, mutate the data frames we created for these to include new variables explaining how well the properties accommodate guests in terms of bathrooms, and then create density charts to visualise the sizes of the properties which we are exploring.
```{r, property related variables and exploratory charts}

property_specific <- property_specific %>% 
  mutate(bathrooms_per_guest=bathrooms/accommodates,
         bedrooms_per_guest=bedrooms/accommodates)


property_specific_longer <- property_specific %>% 
  select(bathrooms_per_guest,
         bedrooms_per_guest,
         bathrooms,
         bedrooms,
         beds,
         accommodates) %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to="variable_name", values_to="values",everything())

ggplot(property_specific_longer, aes(x=values), na.rm=TRUE)+
  geom_density(fill="grey")+
  facet_wrap(vars(variable_name), scales="free", ncol=3)+
  labs(title="Property related variables affecting prices of Airbnb in Barcelona", x="", y="Density")+
  theme(axis.title = element_text()) + 
  theme(axis.text.y=element_blank())+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL


```

## We can see from the positively skewed density charts that the mean size of the properties tends to be smaller, as they tell us the following:

## Chart 1 shows us that the majority of houses seem to accommodate only between 2 and 6 people, with a sizeable number also accommodating 8.

## Chart 2 shows the vast majority of households 1 and 2 bathrooms, with Chart 3 explaining the average individual guest is more likely to have access to less than 3 bathrooms.

## Chart 4 shows that the majority of households contain in between 1 and 3 bedrooms, with Chart 5 interestingly showing that the majority of individual guests don't get access to a bedroom fully to themselves, although Chart 6 does show that the average household holds between 1 and 4 beds.

## Over all, this data displays how the majority of AirBnB households in Barcelona are likely to be medium-size, as the majority of them accommodate a good amount of people (2-6), hold between 1 or 2 bathrooms, and 1 to 3 bedrooms. Despite guests having to share the bedrooms and bathrooms, this is not uncommon in most middle-sized accommodations.

## Now, we proceed to look at host-related data which informs us on host message response rates, acceptance rates, number of listings and whether the host is a superhost.

```{r, host related variables and explanatory charts}

barcelona$host_response_rate <- as.numeric(gsub("\\%","",barcelona$host_response_rate))
barcelona$host_acceptance_rate <- as.numeric(gsub("\\%","",barcelona$host_acceptance_rate))

barcelona$host_response_rate <- barcelona$host_response_rate/100
barcelona$host_acceptance_rate <- barcelona$host_acceptance_rate/100

host_specific <- barcelona %>% 
  select(host_response_rate,
         host_acceptance_rate,
         host_listings_count,
         ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to= "data_names", values_to="data_values", everything())

ggplot(host_specific, aes(x = data_values), na.rm=TRUE) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue") +
  facet_wrap(vars(data_names), scales="free") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Density", title = "Host-Specific Variables affecting Prices of AirBnB in Barcelona") +
  theme_bw() +
  NULL

```
## These charts display host-specific information that might affect the prices of listings in Barcelona. What is interesting about these charts, is that they all have some surprising outliers.

## For example, although Chart 1 agrees with the rationale that most hosts have a relatively high acceptance rate for rentals of their properties, we can see a surprising amount of hosts almost always denying guests at their properties, which is represented on the left side of the chart.

## Further, though Chart 2 also agrees with common sense that most hosts won't be superhosts, we can see that there is still a good proportion of hosts which are. This data agrees with the table we saw earlier, which detailed the ratio of normal hosts to superhosts being about 1:4.

###wait but doesnt the chart give us the OPPOSITE intuition?###

## It also makes sense for the distribution to be on either of the two edges, as the logical nature of the data renders it always hold one of two variables (either 1 or 0).

## Chart 3 does mostly make sense as well, considering it is highly unlikely that we will see a large quantity of hosts with more than around 50 listings; however, as we can also see, there do also seem to be hosts with an incredible amount of more than 150 listings.

## Finally, Chart 4 shows that the majority of hosts tend to respond to requests and messages, but there is also a relatively significant proportion of the host population that doesn't fit this description, as the distribution is rather spread out, like chart 1.

```{r, reviews related variables and exploratory charts}

reviews_specific %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to= "data_names", values_to="data_values", everything())%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = data_values), na.rm=TRUE) +
  geom_density(fill = "red",alpha = 0.4) +
  facet_wrap(vars(data_names), scales="free") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Density", title = "Reviews-Specific Variables affecting Prices of AirBnB in Barcelona") +
  theme_bw() +
  NULL

```
## Now, we move on to exploring the logical variables and commenting on the tables which visualise them. In this section we analyse how many hosts and their bookings fit such descriptions as a "Superhost","Profile Picture","Verified Identity","Avaliability" or "Instant Bookable".

```{r, logical variables and explanatory table}

#rename logical variables
colnames(logical_specific) <- c("Superhost", "Profile Picture", "Verified Identity", "Availability", "Instant Bookable")

#create table to better visualise logical variables
logical_visualisation <- logical_specific %>%
  
  #pivot table to perform next steps
  pivot_longer(cols = 1:5,
               names_to = "var",
               values_to = "logical") %>% 
  
  #group by variable and logical result (True or False)
  group_by(var, logical) %>%
  
  #count number of True and False for each variable
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  
  #pivot wider to have one row per variable and one column for each "True" and "False" count
  pivot_wider(names_from = "logical",
              values_from = "count")
#rename columns
colnames(logical_visualisation) <- c("Logical Variable", "True", "False")

#display table
logical_visualisation

```
 
## Looking at the above table and considering what each variable represents we can conclude that:
## - most flats are not available, this potentially reflects a high demand and could influence prices (for instance the cheapest flats or the flats with the best price/quality balance are probably already booked)
## - a majority (~55%) of flats are instantly bookable, however, the distribution of True vs False is the most balanced of all variables. This could potentially have an impact on the price.
## - almost all the hosts have a profile picture, thus this probably has no impact on the price.
## - a large majority (~80%) of hosts are superhosts, considering that superhosts are hosts who received great ratings, this probably has an important impact on the price.
## - a large majority (~80%) of hosts' identities are verified, considering this is an indicator of security, it probably influences the price.


```{r, categorical variables and descriptive graphs}

categorical_specific_longer <- categorical_specific %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to="variable_name", values_to="values",everything()) %>% 
  group_by(variable_name,values) %>% 
  mutate(observations=n())

ggplot(categorical_specific_longer, aes(y=reorder(values,observations)),
                                        na.rm=TRUE)+
  geom_bar(fill="grey",orientation = "y")+
  facet_wrap(vars(variable_name), scales="free", ncol=1)+
  labs(title="Categorical variables affecting prices of Airbnb in Barcelona",
             x="", y="Density")+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL



```

## Analyzing from a categorical perspective, we can see there are obvious preferences for AirBnB in Barcelona of individual guests.
## For neighbourboods, Eixample is significantly the top choice, followed by Ciutat Vella, and then are Sants-Montjuic, Sant Marti, Gracia and so on. 
## For property types, the top two choices are entire rental unit and private room in rental unit, which are remarkably preferred than the rest types. 
## As for room types, the majority individual guests significantly prefer entire home/apartment and private room rather than hotel room or shared room. 
## Thus, in conclusion, we can tell that categories of neighbourhood, property type and room type do influence guests' preferences and choices of AirBnB in Barcelona. 



# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


[[##To start with, through EDA we will attempt to answer to following questions:

1. Which variables are relevant?
2. Does the data need cleaning?
3. Do we have outliers which we need to exclude?
4. Are there variables we need to convert?
5. Are there any additional variables we need to create based on the manipulation of existing data?
6. What is the relationship between the relevant variables? (Through this, we want to examine how successfully independent variables explain dependent variables)
7. What are the dependent and independent variables?

Conduct a thorough EDA. Recall that an EDA involves three things:

* Looking at the raw values.
    * `dplyr::glimpse()`
* Computing summary statistics of the variables of interest, or finding NAs
    * `mosaic::favstats()`
    * `skimr::skim()`
* Creating informative visualizations.
    * `ggplot2::ggplot()`
        * `geom_histogram()` or `geom_density()` for numeric continuous variables
        * `geom_bar()` or `geom_col()` for categorical variables
    * `GGally::ggpairs()` for scaterrlot/correlation matrix
        * Note that you can add transparency to points/density plots in the `aes` call, for example: `aes(colour = gender, alpha = 0.4)`
        
You may wish to have a level 1 header (`#`) for your EDA, then use level 2 sub-headers (`##`) to make sure you cover all three EDA bases. **At a minimum** you should address these questions:

- How many variables/columns? How many rows/observations?
- Which variables are numbers?
- Which are categorical or *factor* variables (numeric or character variables with variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values?
- What are the correlations between variables? Does each scatterplot support a linear relationship between variables? Do any of the correlations appear to be conditional on the value of a categorical variable?

At this stage, you may also find you want to use `filter`, `mutate`, `arrange`, `select`, or `count`. Let your questions lead you! 

> In all cases, please think about the message your plot is conveying. Don’t just say "This is my X-axis, this is my Y-axis", but rather what’s the **so what** of the plot. Tell some sort of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns in no more than a paragraph.

## Data wrangling

Once you load the data, it's always a good idea to use `glimpse` to see what kind of variables you have and what data type (`chr`, `num`, `logical`, `date`, etc) they are. 

Notice that some of the price data (`price`) is given as a character string, e.g., "$176.00"

Since `price` is a quantitative variable, we need to make sure it is stored as numeric data `num` in the dataframe. To do so, we will first use `readr::parse_number()` which drops any non-numeric characters before or after the first number

```
listings <- listings %>% 
  mutate(price = parse_number(price))
```
  
Use `typeof(listing$price)` to confirm that `price` is now stored as a number.


## Propery types


Next, we look at the variable `property_type`. We can use the `count` function to determine how many categories there are their frequency. What are the top 4 most common property types? What proportion of the total listings do they make up? 

Since the vast majority of the observations in the data are one of the top four or five property types, we would like to create a simplified version of `property_type` variable that has 5 categories: the top four categories and `Other`. Fill in the code below to create `prop_type_simplified`.

```
listings <- listings %>%
  mutate(prop_type_simplified = case_when(
    property_type %in% c("______","______", "______","______") ~ property_type, 
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))
  
```
Use the code below to check that `prop_type_simplified` was correctly made.

```
listings %>%
  count(property_type, prop_type_simplified) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))        
```        

Airbnb is most commonly used for travel purposes, i.e., as an alternative to traditional hotels. We only want to include  listings in our regression analysis that are intended for travel purposes:

- What are the  most common values for the variable `minimum_nights`? 
- Is there any value among the common values that stands out? 
- What is the likely intended purpose for Airbnb listings with this seemingly unusual value for `minimum_nights`?

Filter the airbnb data so that it only includes observations with `minimum_nights <= 4`

        
# Mapping 

Visualisations of feature distributions and their relations are key to understanding a data set, and they can open up new lines of exploration. While we do not have time to go into all the wonderful geospatial visualisations one can do with R, you can use the following code to start with a map of your city, and overlay all AirBnB coordinates to get an overview of the spatial distribution of AirBnB rentals. For this visualisation we use the `leaflet` package, which includes a variety of tools for interactive maps, so you can easily zoom in-out, click on a point to get the actual AirBnB listing for that specific point, etc.

The following code, having downloaded a dataframe `listings` with all AirbnB listings in Milan, will plot on the map all AirBnBs where `minimum_nights` is less than equal to four (4). You could learn more about `leaflet`, by following [the relevant Datacamp course on mapping with leaflet](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/interactive-maps-with-leaflet-in-r)


```{r, out.width = '80%'}

leaflet(data = filter(listings, minimum_nights <= 4)) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   radius = 1, 
                   fillColor = "blue", 
                   fillOpacity = 0.4, 
                   popup = ~listing_url,
                   label = ~property_type)
```

    
# Regression Analysis

For the target variable $Y$, we will use the cost for two people to stay at an Airbnb location for four (4) nights. 

Create a new variable called `price_4_nights` that uses `price`, and `accomodates` to calculate the total cost for two people to stay at the Airbnb property for 4 nights. This is the variable $Y$ we want to explain.

Use histograms or density plots to examine the distributions of `price_4_nights` and `log(price_4_nights)`. Which variable should you use for the regression model? Why?

```{r}
barcelona_analysis <- barcelona %>% 
  
  #filter for 2 people
  filter(accommodates >= 2) %>%
  
  #calculate price for 4 nights 
  mutate(price_4_nights = price * 4,
         logprice_4_nights = log(price_4_nights))

#create desnity plot
ggplot(data = barcelona_analysis, aes(price_4_nights)) +
  geom_density()+
  #add title and axis titles
  labs(title = "Density Plot of the Price for 2 People for  4 Nights", 
       y = "Density", 
       x = "Price for 2 for 4 Nights")+
  #change theme
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

#create density plot with logarithmic scale
ggplot(data = barcelona_analysis, aes(logprice_4_nights)) +
  geom_density()+
  #add title and axis titles
  labs(title = "Density Plot of the Price for 2 People for 4 Nights - Logarithmic Scale", 
       y = "Density - Logarithmic", 
       x = "Price for 2 for 4 Nights")+
  #change theme
  theme_bw()+
  NULL


```

## We will use the normally distributed logprice_4_nights for our analysis.

## Model 1
Fit a regression model called `model1` with the following explanatory variables: `prop_type_simplified`, `number_of_reviews`, and `review_scores_rating`. 

- Interpret the coefficient `review_scores_rating` in terms of `price_4_nights`.
- Interpret the coefficient of `prop_type_simplified` in terms of `price_4_nights`.

```{r}
model1 <- lm(logprice_4_nights ~ prop_type_simplified + number_of_reviews + review_scores_rating, data = barcelona_analysis)
msummary(model1)
```

## - According to the regression analysis, coefficient of `review_scores_rating` in terms of `logprice_4_nights` is 0.06255, which indicates if `review_scores_rating` increase by 1, `price_4_nights` will increase by exp(0.06255)-1 = 6.455%.

## - According to the regression analysis, coefficients of `prop_type_simplifiedEntire rental unit`, `prop_type_simplifiedEntire serviced apartment`, `prop_type_simplifiedOther` and `prop_type_simplifiedPrivate room in rental unit` in terms of `logprice_4_nights` are -0.0003, 0.3349, -0.3822 and -0.9296 respectively.
##   - If property type changes from `Entire condominium (condo)` to `Entire rental unit`, `price_4_nights` will decrease by exp(0.0003176)-1 = 0.0318%.
##    - If property type changes from `Entire condominium (condo)` to `Entire serviced apartment`, `price_4_nights` will increase by exp(0.3349)-1 = 39.78%.
##    - If property type changes from `Entire condominium (condo)` to `Other`, `price_4_nights` will decrease by exp(0.3822)-1 = 46.55%.
##    - If property type changes from `Entire condominium (condo)` to `Private room in rental unit`, `price_4_nights` will decrease by exp(0.9296)-1 = 153.346%.

## We want to determine if `room_type` is a significant predictor of the cost for 4 nights, given everything else in the model. Fit a regression model called model2 that includes all of the explananatory variables in `model1` plus `room_type`. 

```{r}
model2 <- lm(logprice_4_nights ~ prop_type_simplified + number_of_reviews + review_scores_rating + room_type, data = barcelona_analysis)
msummary(model2)
```

## Further variables/questions to explore on our own

Our dataset has many more variables, so here are some ideas on how you can extend your analysis

1. Are the number of `bathrooms`, `bedrooms`, `beds`, or size of the house (`accomodates`) significant predictors of `price_4_nights`? Or might these be co-linear variables?

```{r}
model3 <- lm(logprice_4_nights ~ prop_type_simplified + number_of_reviews + review_scores_rating + room_type + bathrooms + bedrooms + beds + accommodates, 
             data = barcelona_analysis)
msummary(model3)
car::vif(model3)
```

To make GVIFs comparable across variables, we can use the Square of GVIF^(1/(2*DF)).  This reduces GVIF to a linear measure.  If the calculated value is less than 5, then we can conclude that there is no Multicollinearity.

Accommodates reflects collinearity as the Square of (2.352034)^2 > 5.  Hence, we remove this variable from our analysis.


## According to the regression, `bathrooms` and `accommodates` does command a pricing premium, `bedrooms` and `beds` does not command a pricing premium after controlling for other variable. We need to remove`bedrooms` and `beds`from the model.

## According to the VIF, there are no significant co-linear variables that we need to remove.


1. Do superhosts `(host_is_superhost`) command a pricing premium, after controlling for other variables?

```{r}
model4 <- lm(logprice_4_nights ~ prop_type_simplified + number_of_reviews + review_scores_rating + room_type + bathrooms + host_is_superhost, 
             data = barcelona_analysis)
msummary(model4)
```

## According to the regression, superhosts `(host_is_superhost`) does not command a pricing premium, after controlling for other variable. We need to remove it from the model.


1. Some hosts allow you to immediately book their listing (`instant_bookable == TRUE`), while a non-trivial proportion don't. After controlling for other variables, is `instant_bookable` a significant predictor of `price_4_nights`?

```{r}
model5 <- lm(logprice_4_nights ~ prop_type_simplified + number_of_reviews + review_scores_rating + room_type + bathrooms +  instant_bookable, 
             data = barcelona_analysis)
msummary(model5)

```

## According to the regression, `instant_bookable` is a significant predictor of `price_4_nights`.

1. For all cities, there are 3 variables that relate to neighbourhoods: `neighbourhood`, `neighbourhood_cleansed`, and `neighbourhood_group_cleansed`. There are typically more than 20 neighbourhoods in each city, and it wouldn't make sense to include them all in your model. Use your city knowledge, or ask someone with city knowledge, and see whether you can group neighbourhoods together so the majority of listings falls in fewer (5-6 max) geographical areas. You would thus need to create a new categorical variabale `neighbourhood_simplified` and determine whether location is a predictor of `price_4_nights`

```{r}
model6 <- lm(logprice_4_nights ~ prop_type_simplified + number_of_reviews + review_scores_rating + room_type + bathrooms + instant_bookable + neighbourhood_simplified, 
             data = barcelona_analysis)
msummary(model6)
```


1. What is the effect of `avalability_30` or `reviews_per_month` on `price_4_nights`, after we control for other variables?

```{r}
model7 <- lm(logprice_4_nights ~ prop_type_simplified + number_of_reviews + review_scores_rating + room_type + bathrooms + instant_bookable + neighbourhood_simplified + availability_30 + reviews_per_month,
             data = barcelona_analysis)
msummary(model7)
```

## According to the regression, `avalability_30` and `reviews_per_month` have significance effects on `price_4_nights`. If the availability of the listing 30 days increases by 1, `price_4_nights` will increase by exp(0.01149)-1 = 1.16%. If `reviews_per_month` increase by 1, `price_4_nights` will decrease by exp(0.01382)-1 = 1.39%.


## Diagnostics, collinearity, summary tables


As you keep building your models, it makes sense to:

1. Check the residuals, using `autoplot(model_x)`

```{r}
autoplot(model7)

```

## According to the QQ plot, residuals roughly obey Normal Distribution. But it needs further improvement.

1. As you start building models with more explanatory variables, make sure you use `car::vif(model_x)`` to calculate the **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** for your predictors and determine whether you have colinear variables. A general guideline is that a VIF larger than 5 or 10 is large, and your model may suffer from collinearity. Remove the variable in question and run your model again without it.
```{r}
car::vif(model7)

```


1. Create a summary table, using `huxtable` (https://mfa2022.netlify.app/example/modelling_side_by_side_tables/) that shows which models you worked on, which predictors are significant, the adjusted $R^2$, and the Residual Standard Error.

```{r}
huxreg(model1, model2, model3, model4, model5, model6, model7)

```

## According to huxtable, we decide to choose model7 for its R2 is the highest and all the variables are significant except Entire rental unit within property_type_simplified.

```{r, best model}
best_model <- lm(logprice_4_nights ~ prop_type_simplified + review_scores_rating + room_type + minimum_nights + bathrooms + bedrooms + accommodates + instant_bookable + neighbourhood_simplified + availability_30 + reviews_per_month + host_is_superhost + host_response_rate + host_acceptance_rate + review_scores_cleanliness + review_scores_checkin + review_scores_location + review_scores_value,
             data = barcelona_analysis)
msummary(best_model)
car::vif(best_model)
huxreg(model1, model7, best_model)


```




```{r, test and Training data}

```
1. Finally, you must use the best model you came up with for prediction. Suppose you are planning to visit the city you have been assigned to over reading week, and you want to stay in an Airbnb. Find Airbnb's in your destination city that are apartments with a private room, have at least 10 reviews, and an average rating of at least 90. Use your best model to predict the total cost to stay at this Airbnb for 4 nights. Include the appropriate 95% interval with your prediction. Report the point prediction and interval in terms of `price_4_nights`. 



  - if you used a log(price_4_nights) model, make sure you anti-log to convert the value in $.

# Deliverables


- By midnight on Monday 17 Oct 2022, you must upload on Canvas a short presentation (max 4-5 slides) with your findings, as some groups will be asked to present in class. You should present your Exploratory Data Analysis, as well as your best model. In addition, you must upload on Canvas your final report, written  using R Markdown to introduce, frame, and describe your story and findings. You should include the following in the memo:

1. Executive Summary: Based on your best model, indicate the factors that influence `price_4_nights`.
This should be written for an intelligent but non-technical audience. All
other sections can include technical writing.
2. Data Exploration and Feature Selection: Present key elements of the data, including tables and
graphs that help the reader understand the important variables in the dataset. Describe how the
data was cleaned and prepared, including feature selection, transformations, interactions, and
other approaches you considered.
3. Model Selection and Validation: Describe the model fitting and validation process used. State
the model you selected and why they are preferable to other choices.
4. Findings and Recommendations: Interpret the results of the selected model and discuss
additional steps that might improve the analysis
  
  

Remember to follow R Markdown etiquette rules and style; don't have the Rmd output extraneous messages or warnings, include summary tables in nice tables (use `kableExtra`), and remove any placeholder texts from past Rmd templates; in other words, (i.e. I don't want to see stuff I wrote in your final report.)
